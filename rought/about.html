        <p class="abouttxt">
            Studying at my 12th and final year of school, my ambition is to become a self-taught developer and entrepreneur. 
            I also have a wide range of skills, including video editing, photo editing, 2D animation, 3D animation, photography, and videography. 
            I am passionate about learning new things, and I am always eager to expand my knowledge and grow as a person. I strive for excellence in all of my endeavors, 
            and I always strive to make the best out of any situation. My determination and drive have helped me to get where I am today and I am confident that 
            I can continue to reach new heights.
