            I have completed class 12 and I am currently waiting for my results. 
            I am hoping that my results will be good, as it is 
            important for my future plans. In the meantime, I am 
            taking advantage of my free time and trying to become a
            self-taught Flutter developer. I have been using
            various online resources to learn more about Flutter
            and its capabilities. I believe that this will be a
            valuable skill for me in the future, as mobile
            development is becoming more and more important 
            in today's world. By learning Flutter, I will not
            only be able to create my own apps, but also 
            contribute to the development of the mobile app
            industry. I am excited to see where this journey
             will take me and am eager to continue learning and
              growing as a developer.
